# BERT-SentimentWithFlask

The Sentiment Analysis model was created using pre-trained BERT transformer large-scale language learnings and the PyTorch Framework to analyse the IMDB dataset. Data loaders were built to help with batch processing, and then an Optimizer and Scheduler are set up to monitor the model's training.
The model's performance metrics were designed, and then a Training loop was created to monitor PyTorch.The fine-tuned model that had been pre-trained was loaded, and its output was evaluated, resulting in enhanced accuracy of 98%.And  create a local server to deploy in a small scale, the model by running app.py.
